Hi. I am new to programming. I am 59 and working on a degree in Computer Science. I also have 
my Security+ and I am working on my Network+ and my CEH. My end game is Cyber Security with my
focus being in Forensics.
As you look through my programs, please feel free to let me know if there is anything wrong 
and if you see a better way to do something please share it with me. After all, learning is
the key to success.
Thank you for visiting my repository.
